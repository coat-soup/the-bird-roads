# The Bird Roads
The Bird Roads is an upcoming action/adventure game currently in development. With a focus on dynamic narrative, the game relies on a [backend simulation](https://github.com/i-be-keggles/world-sim/) running the world, and letting every action the player takes have a significant impact on the world and the story.
